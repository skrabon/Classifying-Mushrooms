# Classifying Mushrooms Project
By Sara Rabon

### Background
This project is based out of this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification "Kaggle Competition") about
classifying mushrooms in specific classes. The ultimate goal is to be able to determine if a mushroom is poisonous
or not based off of deterministic features. Unfortunately, there is no easy rule to deciding if a mushroom is safe to eat, so the competition works off the idea of coming up with an accurate model that ideally won't have anyone eating poisonous mushrooms.

### Data
The data from the competition was split into a training set, with labels, and a test set, without labels. Each set has the same 23 features and overall there are 8124 examples. 

### Code
For this project, I used Python and the libraries pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The code is imported from a kaggle kernal. I use random forests from sklearn to create a machine learning model. For more indepth information about the code, check out the comments on the file

### Outcome
More to come. My goal is to create a visualization from the data and produce several models to compare against.
