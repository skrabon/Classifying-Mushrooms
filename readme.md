# Classifying Mushrooms Project
By Sara Rabon

### Background
This project is based out of the Kaggle competition(https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) about
classifying mushrooms in specific classes. The ultimate goal is to be able to determine if a mushroom is poisonous
or not based off of deterministic features.
